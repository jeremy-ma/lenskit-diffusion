# LensKit with Diffusion

helper.py contains python helper functions which generate the diffusion matrices which
are used by lenskit.

run.py contains python scripts which run test sets and processes the resulting output
from lenskit.

Eventually I will port the python code into lenskit so that it's all packaged nicely....
